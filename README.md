# Walmart Sales Data Analysis

numpy==1.19.2
pandas==1.1.3
torch==1.7.0

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset of Walmart's sales transactions to identify key trends, seasonality, and patterns in sales performance. The analysis includes:

- Data analysis and visualization using R and ggplot2.
- Developing a deep learning model (LSTM network) using PyTorch for predicting future sales.

## Technologies Used
- R
- ggplot2 (for R)
- Python
- PyTorch (for Python)

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
- R and RStudio
- Python
- PyTorch and other Python dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation
To install R packages:
```R
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("lubridate")

pip install -r requirements.txt

**Running the Analysis**
Run Walmart_Sales_Analysis.R in RStudio or your preferred R environment to perform data analysis and visualization.
Run LSTM_Walmart.py in a Python environment to train and evaluate the LSTM model.
